# simple-2d-platformer
This is a simple 2d endless platformer game that I have created. This is to help me as a stepping stone into game development.
## Controls
Using WASD, to control the player.
### Game Objectives
Avoid the wall and navigating over obstacles to get as much point as you can.
###### Code Sample
```csharp
//To get points adding them per frame.
GameManager manager;

while(true)
{
  manager.points++
} 

```
